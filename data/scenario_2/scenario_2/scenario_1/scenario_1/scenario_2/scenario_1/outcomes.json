You must solve the riddle to proceed further into the Forgotten Kingdom."}, {"result": "As you hold the glowing amulet up to the stone door, the ancient runes begin to shimmer and pulse with a matching light. The door vibrates slightly under your touch, and a low rumbling sound echoes through the chamber. Suddenly, the door splits down the middle and swings open, revealing a vast hall bathed in a soft, ethereal light. The griffon squawks in approval and flaps its wings excitedly.", "new_situation": "You now stand at the entrance of the grand hall of the Forgotten Kingdom. The air is thick with ancient magic and the echoes of long-lost voices. The griffon takes flight and circles above you, its keen eyes scanning the area. The hall is lined with towering statues of Eldoria's past rulers, their stony gazes fixed on the large throne at the end of the hall. On the throne, a spectral figure sits, its form flickering like a candle in the wind. It seems to be waiting for you. The secrets of the Forgotten Kingdom and the fate of Eledor are within your grasp."}]
