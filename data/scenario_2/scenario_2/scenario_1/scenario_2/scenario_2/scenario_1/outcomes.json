[{"result": "You and your griffon companion venture down the left path, the green glow growing brighter with each step. As you draw closer, you realize the glow emanates from a cluster of large, emerald-colored crystals jutting out from the cavern walls. The crystals pulse with a strange energy, their light casting eerie shadows on the cavern floor. ", "new_situation": "As you approach the crystals, you notice they're etched with ancient runes. You recognize these as the language of the old sages, a language Eledor taught you. The runes seem to form a riddle, a test for those who seek the Forgotten Kingdom. You must solve this riddle to proceed further. Meanwhile, the griffon seems restless, its eyes darting towards the shadows. It appears you're not alone in the cavern. Something lurks in the darkness, watching. Will you focus on the riddle or address the potential threat first?"}, {"result": "You cautiously tread down the middle path, the rhythmic thumping growing louder with each step. As you round a bend, the source of the sound comes into view. A massive, stone door, adorned with ancient runes, is being pounded by a colossal golem, its stone fists creating the rhythmic thumping. The golem doesn't seem to notice your presence, focused solely on its task.", "new_situation": "You are now standing in front of a massive stone door with a golem pounding on it. The runes on the door glow faintly, pulsating in sync with the golem's pounding. The griffon at your side ruffles its feathers, eyeing the golem warily. Will you attempt to communicate with the golem, decipher the runes on the door, or look for another way around?"}]
