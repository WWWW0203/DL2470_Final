Their keen senses and knowledge of the forest prove invaluable as they lead you safely through treacherous terrain and hidden pitfalls. As you journey deeper, the forest becomes eerily silent, and the ancient coin in your hand glows brighter, its light piercing the darkness. Suddenly, the wolves stop. They growl softly, their eyes fixed on a large, moss-covered stone door embedded in a hillside. The door is adorned with ancient symbols, and the coin in your hand resonates with the same symbols. It seems you have found the entrance to the Forgotten Kingdom.", "new_situation": "You stand before the entrance to the Forgotten Kingdom, the ancient coin pulsating in your hand.

The fate of Eldoria hangs in the balance, and the next choice you make could determine the fate of your mentor, Eledor."}, {"result": "You decide to take a moment to rest and prepare your supplies for the journey ahead.
