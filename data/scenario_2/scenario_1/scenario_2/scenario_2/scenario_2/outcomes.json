The fire spell works perfectly, keeping you comfortably warm despite the freezing conditions outside.", "new_situation": "Now protected from the cold, you continue your journey across the tundra. The griffon flies steadily, its powerful wings cutting through the icy wind. As you travel further north, you notice a faint glow on the horizon. It's too far to make out clearly, but it seems to be coming from a structure of some sort. Could this be the Forgotten Kingdom you've been searching for? You urge your griffon to fly faster towards the mysterious glow."}, {"result": "Your keen eyes scan the icy landscape below, searching for any signs of shelter or civilization. Amidst the white expanse, you spot a faint wisp of smoke rising into the sky. You guide the griffon towards it, and as you get closer, you see a small settlement nestled in a valley, protected from the harsh winds. It appears to be a village of some sort, with small huts made of ice and snow. There's a larger structure in the center, perhaps a meeting hall or a place of worship. The villagers, bundled up in furs, look up in surprise as you descend on your griffon.", "new_situation": "You have found a small settlement in the icy tundra. The villagers seem wary but not hostile. You must find a way to communicate with them, learn more about this area, and perhaps get some help in your quest to find the Forgotten Kingdom. The griffon, tired from the long flight, needs rest and food. You also need to find shelter from the biting cold. Your journey in the icy wilderness of Eldoria continues."}]
