[{"result": "The griffon, understanding your command, beats its powerful wings harder and ascends higher into the sky. The wind whistles past your ears as the ground below becomes a blur of green and brown. The view from this height is breathtaking. You can see the expanse of Eldwood Forest, the towering Eldoria Mountains to the east, the tranquil Elden Lake to the west, and the vast Eldoria Plains to the south. You also notice a peculiar formation to the north, beyond the forest. It appears to be a series of ancient, crumbling structures, partially hidden by the forest canopy. Could this be the Forgotten Kingdom?", "new_situation": "You are now high above the Eldwood Forest, with a panoramic view of Eldoria. You've spotted a potential location for the Forgotten Kingdom to the north. You must decide whether to continue flying north towards the ancient structures, descend back into the forest, or change your course to explore the other regions of Eldoria."}, {"result": "You pull out the magical compass given to you by Eledor. The needle spins wildly for a moment before slowing down and pointing directly north. The Forgotten Kingdom lies somewhere in that direction, beyond the Eldwood Forest.", "new_situation": "With the direction now clear, you urge the griffon to fly faster towards the north. The forest below starts to thin out, giving way to a vast, icy tundra. The temperature drops significantly, and you pull your cloak tighter around you. The journey to the Forgotten Kingdom continues, now over the frozen wastes of the northern tundra. You wonder what challenges and mysteries await you in this icy wilderness."}]
