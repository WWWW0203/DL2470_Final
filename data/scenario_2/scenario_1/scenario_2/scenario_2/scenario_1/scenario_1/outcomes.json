The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient stone, and there's a palpable sense of history around you. ", "new_situation": "You are now standing in the heart of the Forgotten Kingdom. The city is laid out before you, a labyrinth of crumbling buildings and overgrown paths. To your left, you see what appears to be an ancient library, its shelves still filled with dusty tomes. To your right, a grand palace stands, its once magnificent facade now weathered by time. Straight ahead, a towering statue of a forgotten king looms, pointing towards an old marketplace. Each location holds potential clues to Eledor's whereabouts. Where will you go first? The library, the palace, or the marketplace? The choice is yours."}, {"result": "As you continue to fly, the wind rustling through your hair, you get a bird's eye view of the Forgotten Kingdom.
