The ancient structures grow larger and more defined as you approach, and you can make out the remnants of old towers, crumbling walls, and a large, ominous gate. The air grows colder, and an eerie silence envelops you as you enter the airspace above the Forgotten Kingdom.", "new_situation": "You are now hovering above the Forgotten Kingdom, an ancient city that time seems to have forgotten. The once grand structures are now in ruins, but there's a certain beauty in their decay.

You can land and explore the Forgotten Kingdom on foot, or continue flying to survey the area from above. The choice is yours."}, {"result": "You gently guide your magical mount, a majestic griffin, to descend back into the forest.
