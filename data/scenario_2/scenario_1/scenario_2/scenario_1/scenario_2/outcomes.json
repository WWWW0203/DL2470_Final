[{"result": "You manage to gather a small pile of firewood from the sparse vegetation around the cave. With a bit of effort and the use of a flint and steel from your pack, you succeed in starting a fire. The flames crackle and dance, casting flickering shadows on the cave walls. The warmth from the fire gradually seeps into your bones, driving away the biting cold.", "new_situation": "You are now in the relative comfort of the cave, the fire providing much-needed warmth. The griffon has moved closer to the fire, its golden eyes reflecting the flames. The cave is small but provides enough shelter from the harsh weather outside. As you sit by the fire, you contemplate your next move. The journey up the Eldoria Mountains will be treacherous and filled with unknown dangers. You'll need to plan carefully and gather more supplies before you can proceed. The question remains - where will you find these supplies in such a desolate landscape?"}, {"result": "The griffon, a majestic creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle, tilts its head as you approach. It seems to understand your plight. With a soft chirp, it unfurls its wings and takes off, circling above you before heading towards the cave you noticed earlier. It returns shortly, carrying a bundle of dry wood in its talons, which it drops at your feet. It then uses its beak to nudge you towards the cave. ", "new_situation": "You now have a bundle of dry wood, thanks to the griffon. The cave seems to be the best option for shelter. The griffon has settled down again, watching you with what seems to be curiosity. You need to use the wood to start a fire and keep warm. The journey up the Eldoria Mountains is still ahead, and you'll need to rest and gather your strength before you can continue."}]
