You see a strange, swirling vortex of magical energy, pulsating with an eerie light in a clearing. It appears to be a portal of some sort, a phenomenon unheard of in the Eldwood Forest. You also notice a group of shadowy figures moving towards the portal. Their intentions remain unclear, but their presence in the forest is certainly out of the ordinary.", "new_situation": "The griffon continues to fly north, leaving the Eldwood Forest behind.

Your journey to the Forgotten Kingdom continues, now with more questions than answers."}, {"result": "The griffon, understanding your command, tilts its wings and begins to descend. The wind whips past you as you get closer and closer to the treetops of the Eldwood Forest.
