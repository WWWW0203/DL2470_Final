To your left, a path leads to a towering castle, its spires reaching towards the cavern ceiling. Straight ahead, a path leads to a bustling marketplace, now abandoned and eerily silent.

The fate of Eledor and Eldoria rests on your shoulders. Where will you go next"}, {"result": "Upon closer inspection, you notice a series of ancient symbols etched into the stone around the entrance.
