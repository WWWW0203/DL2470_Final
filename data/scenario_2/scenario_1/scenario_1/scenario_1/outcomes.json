[{"result": "You step forward, your heart pounding in your chest as you approach the rune pedestal. The runes glow brighter as you draw near, bathing the surrounding area in a soft, ethereal light. You reach out, tracing your fingers over the ancient symbols. As an apprentice of Eledor, you have some knowledge of the old languages and you recognize these runes as part of the Eldorian script, a language not used for centuries. You manage to decipher the runes, which read: \"Only the brave may enter, only the wise may leave.\"", "new_situation": "As soon as you finish deciphering the runes, the ground beneath you begins to tremble. The griffon squawks in alarm and takes flight, disappearing into the darkness. The rune pedestal sinks into the ground, and a hidden path opens up, leading deeper into the forest. The path is lit by more glowing runes, creating a mesmerizing trail. You are now faced with a choice: venture into the newly revealed path or retreat and prepare before proceeding. The Forgotten Kingdom awaits, but so do the dangers that lie within."}, {"result": "The griffon, a creature of majesty and wisdom, seems to understand your intentions. It lowers its head in acknowledgement of your friendly gesture and crouches down, allowing you to climb onto its back. The griffon's feathers are surprisingly soft, and its body radiates a comforting warmth. With a powerful leap, it ascends into the air, providing you with a bird's-eye view of the path ahead.", "new_situation": "From atop the griffon, you see the path ahead clearly. It winds through the forest, leading to a large, ancient-looking gate adorned with the same runes as the pedestal. The gate appears to be the entrance to the Forgotten Kingdom. The griffon lands back on the ground, near the rune pedestal. You dismount and thank the griffon for its assistance. Now, with the path to the Forgotten Kingdom revealed, you must decide your next move. Will you approach the gate, or investigate the rune pedestal further? The fate of Eledor and Elden Village hangs in the balance."}]
