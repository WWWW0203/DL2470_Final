The runes on the pedestal begin to glow brighter, and a hidden compartment at its base slides open, revealing a small, intricately carved key. The key is adorned with the same runes as the ones on the pedestal and the gate. It seems you've found the key to the Forgotten Kingdom.", "new_situation": "With the key in your possession, you turn your gaze back to the ancient gate.
