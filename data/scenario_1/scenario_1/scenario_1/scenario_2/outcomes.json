The glow seems to pulse with a rhythm that matches the beating of your heart. The path to the Forgotten Kingdom continues, but the mysterious glow in the clearing beckons you. Will you continue down the path or investigate the glow?"}, {"result": "Your words of encouragement echo through the silent forest, instilling a newfound sense of courage in the villagers.
