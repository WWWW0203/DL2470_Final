As you step into the clearing, the glow coalesces into a spectral figure, a woman with flowing hair and a gown of shimmering light. She is the Spirit of Eldwood, a guardian of the forest. She tells you that she has been waiting for you and offers a piece of advice: \"To find the Forgotten Kingdom, you must first find the Key of Shadows, hidden deep within the Eldoria Mountains.\" She then fades away, leaving you alone in the clearing.", "new_situation": "With the Spirit of Eldwood's advice in mind, you now find yourself with a new objective: to find the Key of Shadows in the Eldoria Mountains.
