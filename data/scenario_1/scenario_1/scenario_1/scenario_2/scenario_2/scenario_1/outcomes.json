The tree is speaking of a hidden path, not visible to the naked eye, leading to the heart of the Eldwood Forest. It warns of the dangers that lurk within, but also speaks of a powerful ally that resides there. The tree's glow intensifies, illuminating a small, almost invisible path leading deeper into the forest.", "new_situation": "The villagers watch in awe as you converse with the ancient tree.

The whispers of the tree still echo in your mind, speaking of a powerful ally waiting in the heart of the forest."}, {"result": "You follow the hidden path, leaving the villagers behind.

As you journey deeper, the whispering sound grows louder, turning into a chorus of hushed voices. You feel a strange energy pulsating around you, a mix of fear and excitement. The path ends abruptly at a large, ancient stone door, etched with runes that glow in the same light as the trees. The whispers seem to be emanating from this door.", "new_situation": "You are now standing in front of an ancient stone door deep within the Eldwood Forest.
