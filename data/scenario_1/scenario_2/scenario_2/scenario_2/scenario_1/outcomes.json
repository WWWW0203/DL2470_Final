You reach into your pouch, pulling out a small, enchanted stone Eledor gave you. With a whisper of an incantation, the stone lights up, casting a warm glow around you. The path is narrow and winding, but the light from the stone guides your way. After what feels like hours, you emerge into a vast, underground cavern. The ceiling is adorned with glowing crystals, casting an ethereal light over a forgotten city, its architecture reminiscent of the ancient Eldorian civilization. You've found it - the Forgotten Kingdom.", "new_situation": "You stand at the entrance of the Forgotten Kingdom, a city lost in time.

As you take a step forward, a sudden movement catches your eye. A shadowy figure darts behind one of the crumbling buildings. Are you alone in this forgotten city, or are there others lurking in the shadows? The fate of Eledor and Elden still hangs in the balance,"}, {"result": "You lean in, squinting your eyes to make out the intricate symbols etched into the tree's ancient bark.

You step forward, entering the archway formed by the tree roots, and start your journey down the dark path, towards the heart of the Forgotten Kingdom."}]
