The guardians' glowing eyes seem to flicker in recognition. They remain silent for a moment, then one of them responds in a deep, resonating voice. The guardians seem to understand your intent and, after a brief exchange, they step aside, revealing the path to the stone door.", "new_situation": "The guardians now stand aside, their glowing eyes no longer focused on you but on the stone door. The path to the door is clear, and you can see intricate carvings on its surface. The carvings depict a map of Eldoria, with a specific location marked. It seems to be the next clue on your journey to find the Forgotten Kingdom. You must decipher the map and determine your next destination."}, {"result": "You approach the guardians cautiously, keeping a respectful distance. As you study the carvings, you notice that they depict scenes from Eldorian mythology. The carvings tell the tale of the ancient Eldorian kings and their connection to the Forgotten Kingdom. One particular carving catches your eye - it shows a king standing before the guardians, his hand raised in a specific gesture. Mimicking the gesture, you raise your hand. The guardians respond instantly, their glowing eyes dimming as they step aside, clearing the path to the stone door.", "new_situation": "With the guardians now at ease, you have a clear path to the stone door. The carvings on the door match those on the guardians, suggesting a similar mechanism to open it. The chamber is silent, the only sound being your own heartbeat echoing in your ears. You stand before the door, ready to unlock the secrets it holds. The fate of Eledor and Elden village lies beyond this door."}]
