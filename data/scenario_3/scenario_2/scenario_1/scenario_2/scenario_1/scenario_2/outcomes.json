It's a tight squeeze, but you manage to wriggle your way through. As you emerge on the other side, you dust yourself off and look around. ", "new_situation": "You find yourself in a long, narrow corridor, lined with ancient murals depicting the history of the Forgotten Kingdom. The air is stale, but there's a faint, sweet scent that you can't quite place. The corridor leads to a large, ornate door at the far end. It's adorned with intricate carvings and a large, circular lock in the center. The lock appears to require some sort of key or mechanism to open. The key, however, is nowhere to be found. You must now find a way to open the door and proceed further into the kingdom."}, {"result": "As you step into the tunnel illuminated by the strange, ethereal glow, the air around you seems to shimmer and change. The walls of the tunnel are covered in luminescent moss, casting a soft, otherworldly light. As you walk deeper, you feel a strange sensation, as if you are being watched. Suddenly, a spectral figure appears before you. It is a ghostly knight, clad in ancient armor. He raises his sword, challenging you to prove your worth.", "new_situation": "You now stand face to face with the spectral knight, his ghostly presence filling the tunnel.
