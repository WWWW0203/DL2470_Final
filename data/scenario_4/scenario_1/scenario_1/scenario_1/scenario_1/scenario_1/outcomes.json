The creature roars in surprise and confusion as its eyes cloud over, effectively blinding it. ", "new_situation": "The Gorgon, now blind, thrashes around wildly, its deadly gaze no longer a threat. However, it's still a formidable opponent with its sharp claws and snake-like hair. You can either take this opportunity to attack, try to sneak past it, or use another spell to further incapacitate the creature."}, {"result": "You quickly raise your shield, its polished surface gleaming under the dim light of the cavern. The Gorgon's gaze meets the reflective surface of your shield and is deflected back at it. The creature lets out a terrifying shriek as it turns into stone, its deadly gaze now its own demise.", "new_situation": "With the Gorgon defeated, you are now free to explore the cavern. The eerie silence is only broken by the occasional drip of water from the stalactites overhead. You notice a faint glow emanating from a narrow tunnel to your right.
