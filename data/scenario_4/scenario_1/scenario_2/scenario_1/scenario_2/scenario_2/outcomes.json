The artifact that you believe is the key to finding Eledor is within your reach. However, the hall is eerily quiet, and you can't shake off the feeling that you're not alone.

They seem to correspond to the constellations in the sky. The symbols are a code, a celestial map that points to the location of the Forgotten Kingdom.

It's a phrase in the ancient Eldorian language, which translates to \"Only the brave can walk the path of shadows.\"", "new_situation": "Armed with this new knowledge, you feel a sense of purpose.
