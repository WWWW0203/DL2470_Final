The crown, encrusted with gems of every color, begins to glow with an ethereal light. You extend a hand, and the moment your fingers touch the cool metal, a surge of energy courses through you. Visions of the Forgotten Kingdom, its rise and fall, its glory and ruin, flood your mind. You see Eledor, trapped in a shadowy realm, his eyes pleading for help. The vision ends as abruptly as it began, leaving you gasping for breath.", "new_situation": "The crown now rests on your head, its weight surprisingly light. The room around you begins to change.

The trapdoor appears to be magically sealed, with intricate runes etched into its surface.
