The passage is steep and slick with moisture, but you manage to navigate it without slipping. As you delve deeper, the air grows colder and the silence more profound. The passage eventually opens up into a vast, underground cavern, filled with towering stalagmites and stalactites that glitter in the faint light. In the heart of the cavern, you see an ancient stone throne, upon which sits a skeletal figure clad in royal attire. You have found the Forgotten Kingdom.", "new_situation": "You now stand in the heart of the Forgotten Kingdom, facing the skeletal figure on the throne. The air is heavy with ancient magic and the weight of a thousand years. The skeletal figure remains motionless, its hollow eye sockets seeming to stare right through you. The enchanted dagger in your hand pulses with energy, reacting to the magic in the air. Will you approach the throne, or will you explore the rest of the cavern? The choice is yours. Remember, the fate of Eledor and the entire village of Elden rests on your shoulders."}, {"result": "As you strike a flint to ignite a fire, a spark leaps onto the dry moss lining the passage walls. The moss catches fire, illuminating the passage with a warm, flickering glow. However, the sudden heat causes the ancient stones to crack and shift.
